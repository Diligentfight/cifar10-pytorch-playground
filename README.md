# cifar10-pytorch-playground
You can play with cifar10 by change models and modify hyper-parameters

## What you can do in this Repo

1. Try some fancy model to run cifar-10 in main
2. You can learn a lot technique to bulid Cnn models
3. Have initial weights in every models
4. From .ipynb import classes and define
5. From main you can learn how to change lr by steps

## ToDo:
- [x] Main file to train model 
- [x] Progress bar and get mean and var
- [x] VGGNet
- [x] GoogleNet
- [x] ResNet(PreAct)
- [] Densenet
- [] MobileNet
- [] Dpn
- [] Visulialize(train data and net)
